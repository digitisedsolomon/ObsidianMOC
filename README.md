# ObsidianMOC!
#### An easy way to generate a MOC for your folder.

## Functionality
Generates a MOC for your Obsidian folder, omitting all non .md files and preexisting MOCs. It is then put in your clipboard to be copied into the MOC location of your chosing. 
One can do all this through the terminal command `obsmoc (your folder)`.

## Initial Setup
To install, run `npm i obsidianmoc`.
Run obsmoc and set your Obsidan vault's directory.

## Operation
Run  `obsmoc (your folder)`.
## Changing the Vault Location
Run `obsmoc (your folder)`.

##### Q: Why specify the vault location
Specifying the vault's location allows the program to ensure it never accesses any other part of the system.
